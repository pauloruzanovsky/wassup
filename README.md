# Wassup, a minimalist chat app

Final Javascript project on The Odin Project's curriculum. In this project, I attempted to replicate a website (Google Chat in this case) trying to implement as many features as I could.

This app was created utilizing React, Typescript and Firebase technologies, specially Firestore and Auth. It was my first close contact with Firebase functionalities, learned to fetch data from the Firestore database, create and manipulate collections and it's respective documents.
